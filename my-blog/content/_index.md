title: "Welcome to Blowfish! :tada:"
description: "This is a demo of the Blowfish theme for Hugo."

哈哈This is a demo site built entirely using Blowfish. It also contains a complete set of [theme documentation]({{< ref "docs" >}}). Blowfish is flexible and is great for both static page-based content (like this demo) or a traditional blog with a feed of recent posts.

Explore the [sample pages]({{< ref "samples" >}}) to get a feel for what Blowfish can do. If you like what you see, check out the project on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish">Github</a> or read the [Installation guide]({{< ref "docs/installation" >}}) to get started.
